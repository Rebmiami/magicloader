	magicloader v1.0 by Rebmiami
	A simple script designed to improve the workflow of large scripts by allowing code to be split between several files.

	HOW TO USE:
	- Place magicloader.lua in the folder you wish to develop your script in
	- Change 'prefix' to the relative path to this folder from your TPT data folder
	- Add all files to be loaded to 'luaFiles' in the order they should be run (they are combined into one chunk)
	    - Specify only the subfolder and file name; exclude the .lua extension
	- Open TPT and open the script manager, then scroll down and run [yourfolder]/magicloader.lua

	- When you are ready to release your script, specify 'outputFolder' and 'outputFilename', then set 'release' to true
		- A file will be outputted to the specified location. Upload this to the script browser.
	
	FEATURES:
	- Loads and concatenates several .lua files and runs them as if they were a single script.
	- Release mode compiles all .lua files into a single file which can be uploaded to the script manager.
	- Custom error handling that tells you which file the error occured in

	magicloader is public domain, meaning you can:
	- Use it in your own scripts without providing any credit
	- Make modifications to the script and release your own versions of it
